                My full name is Katelyn Lindberg. I am a former teacher. I worked in education for 5 years, doing everything from directing sites with Boys and Girls Club to running my 2nd grade classroom. I have a Bachelor's in Elementary Education, which I received in 2019. <br><br>While working as an educator, I had to learn how to balance many different demands on my time, how to think critically about important matters, and how to set goals for both myself and others, and stick with the outlined steps. I worked on close knit teams, so I know how important cooperation and consideration are to working together! <br><br>Since leaving teaching, I have worked mostly in food service while finding my next career move. Luckily, it did not take me long to discover my interest in front end web development! I have been diligently studying since January 2022, accruing over 200 hours put toward learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and completing projects.<br><br>My hobbies and interests include PC gaming (mostly W.o.W. or Civ V, for anyone wondering), roller skating, various types of art, and generally nerding out over whatever thing I love this month!
