**Technologies Used**
-HTML5
-CSS3

**Project Description**
This project was created for the CSS/Flexbox section of _The Odin Project_'s Foundations course. It was the second project of the course. This project will be my future business portfolio, with many upgrades (see below). 

**Reflections**
This project challenged me to use the flexbox feature of CSS. I also practiced border techniques, as I had not used those techniques much previously.

**Future Upgrades**
May update with links to new projects and give it better formatting upon completion of The Odin Project's Advanced HTML and CSS course.
