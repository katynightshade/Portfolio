**Technologies Used**
-HTML5
-CSS3

**Project Description**
This project was created for the CSS/Flexbox section of _The Odin Project_'s Foundations course. It was the second project of the course. This project will be my future business portfolio, with many upgrades (see below). 

**Reflections**
This project challenged me to use the flexbox feature of CSS. I also practiced border techniques, as I had not used those techniques much previously.

**Future Upgrades**
This project needs many upgrades to be ready for use in resumes and job applications. I may keep the SpongeBob icons in the "Get To Know Me" portion of the site, as they perfectly exemplify how I feel about each descriptor. With the HTML, I will be adding links out to all of my other projects, as I complete upgrades on them. This project needs a lot of CSS work, including mobile first design, decision on and implementation of a color palette, making it a more attractive website, and adding pictures of myself. This project does not currently use any JavaScript. I plan to use JavaScript to create functional buttons and animations. I do not want to make this project overly-interactive, as I am able to display my JavaScript skills in many of my other projects in smarter ways.
